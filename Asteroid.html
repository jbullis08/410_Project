            <p>The purpose of this project was to take a data set of as many asteroids as we could find, and using characteristics like albedo, magnitude, distance, diameter, and others, determine a set of about 20 asteroids that could be studied in detail using Pine Mountain Observatory. We downloaded our dataset from the JPL database. The raw data contained information on 2,455 different asteroids. </p>

            <p>We began reducing the dataset by limiting the asteroid selection to those that had characteristics that fell in a specific range. For example, we want asteroids that have a high albedo, low magnitude (bright), small distance, and large diameter. By narrowing down these ranges, we had information on 19 asteroids. We used an ephemeris module to collect information on the right ascension, declination, altitude, and azimuth of each asteroid from January 1, 2014 to December 31, 2014. Our next step was to determine when the asteroids were at an altitude greater than 30 degrees. </p>

            <p>We created different plots with the characteristics and the peak information to determine if observations on these asteroids was going to be possible. In the end, our visualizations revealed that there are only a handful of those 20 asteroids that have the possibility of being observable. This is caused by the limited window in which weather permits observations, as well as the other characteristics like magnitude, distance, and albedo which are limited by the abilities of the Pine Mountain Observatory telescopes. </p>
