        <h1>Magnitude vs Albedo</h1>
        <p class="lead">This is a plot of absolute magnitude versus albedo for a portion of the data  set. We have set a range for both magnitude and albedo. The magnitude is in the range [0:10] and the albedo is in the range [0.2:1]. The purpose of the plot was to start looking for some "top asteroids". In this plot, "top" means high magnitude (low value) and high albedo.</p>
